# BookReviews
This project is my first attempt at full-stack development. The frontend is simple and could be improved but gets the job done. The backend combines tools such as sessions, async, SQlite, API-calls, controllers, javascript and more.

You can basically do two things in this app: search for books and add them to your library where you can add your review of them both in text and number format. 
First, search for a book. If you find the match in the frontend, click on the card and then "Add to library". 
Second, you can then go to the second page where it will hopefully show up and then you can once again click on the book to get the same modal where you can add your review and either sync to DB or delete the book.

Further improvements: 
Make the code tidier, Javascript especially. 
The API calls can be improved because the api itself supports further tags in the search query such as author, subject and so on. That would make the app prettier if the search result itself contains better info.
Perhaps do a lazy load of images to minimize the amount of standard images.
Probably a ton more!
